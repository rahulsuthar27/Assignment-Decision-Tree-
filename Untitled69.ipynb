Instead of allowing the tree to grow fully and then trimming it, pre-pruning stops the splitting of nodes based on certain predefined conditions. These conditions can include reaching a maximum tree depth, having a minimum number of samples required to split a node, or not achieving a significant gain in impurity reduction.\n",
        "\n",

In this method, the tree is first allowed to grow completely, possibly overfitting the training data. Then, branches or subtrees that provide little or no improvement in prediction accuracy on a validation set are removed or replaced with leaf nodes.\n",

        "This process improves the model’s generalization ability by reducing overfitting and simplifying the tree structure.

In Pre-Pruning, the tree building process is stopped early—before it becomes too complex—based on certain conditions like maximum depth, minimum number of samples to split a node, or minimum information gain. This helps save time and prevents overfitting but can sometimes lead to underfitting if stopped too soon.\n",

        "On the other hand, Post-Pruning allows the tree to grow fully and then removes parts of it that do not improve performance on a validation set. It evaluates subtrees and prunes those that add complexity without meaningful gain. Post-pruning is generally more effective because it’s based on actual model performance, but it requires more computational time since the full tree is built first.\n",

It works by splitting the dataset into smaller and smaller regions based on feature values, just like in classification trees. However, instead of using impurity measures like Gini or Entropy, it uses Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or other regression loss functions to find the best splits.\n",

        "answ->Decision Trees can handle missing values in a few intelligent ways. One common method is by ignoring the missing value during the split and only using the samples with known values for that particular feature. Another approach is to assign missing values to the most frequent category (for categorical data) or the mean/median value (for numerical data) before building the tree. Some advanced Decision Tree algorithms, like those in CART or C4.5, handle missing values by using surrogate splits—they find an alternative feature that closely mimics the primary splitting feature to decide where to send the sample. This allows the tree to still make a decision even when some data is missing, improving its flexibility and robustness.\n",

When a categorical feature is selected for a split, the algorithm creates branches for each category (e.g., “Red,” “Blue,” “Green”) or groups of categories, depending on which split gives the best information gain or impurity reduction. For features with many categories, some algorithms may try to group similar categories together to avoid overfitting. Unlike many other machine learning models, Decision Trees do not require one-hot encoding or other transformations for categorical variables, making them simple and effective for such data.**bold text**"
